# Welcome to Modus

Modus is an agent runtime that allows you to build and scale agents, powered by
WebAssembly.

## Getting Started

To run your Modus app locally, use the following command:

```bash
modus dev
```

## Deploying to Hypermode

Modus apps run on Hypermode, the AI development workbench. To deploy your app to
Hypermode, sign up for a Hypermode account at
[hypermode.com](https://hypermode.com). Once linked to your GitHub repo, your
app will be automatically deployed to Hypermode with each push to main.
